There are several existing cyber security datasets used in ML research, including 
the KDD Cup 1999 Data (Hettich & Bay, 1999), the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (Labs, 1998; Lippmann et al., 2000), the ISCX IDS 2012 dataset (Shiravi et al., 2012), and NSL-KDD (Tavallaee et al., 2009), 
which primarily removes duplicates from the KDD Cup 1999 Data.

Each includes millions of records of realistic activity for enterprise applications, with labels for attacks or benign activity. 
The KDD1999, NSLKDD, and ISCX datasets contain network traffic, while the DARPA1998 dataset also includes limited process calls. 

However, these datasets are at best almost a decade old, and are collected on in-premise servers. 
In contrast, BETH contains modern host activity and activity collected from cloud services, making it relevant for current real-world deployments. 
In addition, some datasets include artificial user activity (Shiravi et al., 2012) while BETH contains only real activity. 
BETH is also one of the few datasets to include both kernel-process and network logs, providing a holistic view of malicious behaviour.
